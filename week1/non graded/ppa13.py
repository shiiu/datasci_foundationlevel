#Accept a positive integer x as input, compute the value of this continued fraction 
#and store the result in a variable named cfrac. We will round off your answer to exactly 
#two decimal places. You don't have to print the output to the console, we will take care 
#of that.

num = 2
cfrac = num + 1//cfrac
